Currently most First Responders use a paper or card system in mass casualty incidents. Obviously, this system presents a lot of problems which is why we were tasked with finding an alternative system. We decided on a QRCode-based system is that it has a lot of upside. QR codes are cost-effective and have great readability meaning it can be scanned rapidly.

Our mission is to provide EMS with a reliable and non-interruptive software solution that can serve as an effective mass-casualty incident response platform. Currently, vTriage offer `Android`, `iOS` and `WebApp` applications making it compatible with almost every single device out there.
